# How to Contribute üõ†Ô∏è

This document provides an overview of how you can contribute to Ceramic. We're excited to have you building with us. üéâ

## Report an Issue or Bug

Some guidelines for reporting bugs:

- Make sure that your issue is caused by the corresponding Ceramic library and not your application code.
- Create a simple and minimal test case that demonstrates the bug.
- Search the issues to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, add any additional details in the comments.
- Write a descriptive and specific title.
- Include browser, OS, library version and any other details specific to the environment.
- Check whether the bug can be reproduced in other environments (ie. other browsers).

Create a new issue using the "bug report" template in the appropriate repo. For example, use this for bugs in [Ceramic-js](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

Before submitting your changes run `npm run lint` to find any formatting issues that don't adhere to the original codebase.

### Best Practices

* Dont leave things in done if you are on the core team, since you have the power to take it to closed!\
* Leave closing comments on issues closed but left incomplete or undone, so the community can follow along\
* Submit issues and PRs in the appropriate repo (we use this one as a project hub)\


## Tools
This section contains information about the various tools used by our project.

### Issues and Stories
We use **Github Issues** for individual items of work, such as issues, tasks, and stories. Here's an example.

### Issue Labels and Tags
We use **Github Labels** to label issues. Using labels helps keep issue lists and project boards skimmable. You can see commonly used labels [here](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/labels)
